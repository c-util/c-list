REQUIREMENTS:
        The requirements for c-list are:

            libc (e.g., glibc >= 2.16)

        At build-time, the following software is required:

            meson >= 0.41
            pkg-config >= 0.29

INSTALL:
        The meson build-system is used for c-list. Contact upstream
        documentation for detailed help. In most situations the following
        commands are sufficient to build and install c-list from source:

            $ mkdir build
            $ cd build
            $ meson setup . ..
            $ ninja
            $ ninja test
            # ninja install

        No custom configuration options are available.
