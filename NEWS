c-list - Circular Double Linked List Implementation in Standard ISO-C11

CHANGES WITH 2:

        * Adjust project-name in build-system to reflect the actual project. The
          previous releases incorrectly claimed to be c-rbtree in the build
          system.

        * Add c_list_swap() that swaps two lists given their head pointers.

        * Add c_list_splice() that moves a list.

        * Add LGPL2.1+ as license so c-list can be imported into GPL2 projects.
          It is now officially dual-licensed.

        * As usual a bunch of fixes, additional tests, and documentation
          updates.
